# Mammography Classification
This Project is designed to explore the MIAS Mammography data set provided by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/mias-mammography) with various data science tools learned from the IBM Data Science Course on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science?)
### Requirements
* Keras
* Numpy
* Pandas
* [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/mias-mammography)
### Goal
This project is an exercise with a focus on processing data and also applying a basic machine learning algorythm to classify tissue. It offers an opportunity to experience the problems that arise when data has bias and how that affects the efficacy of a machine learning model. It requires awareness to parse and modify the training data set to ensure the model generalizes and can effectively classify unseen data.
